# Solidity documentation generator

Simple documentation generator for Solidity files, as an alternative to [doxity](https://github.com/DigixGlobal/doxity/), as a candidate to be used for [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity).

This project uses a modified [solidity-antlr4 grammar](https://github.com/solidityj/solidity-antlr4) to extract NatSpec comments as tokens from the lexer, generates markdown files, and feeds them into a [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) template. 

## Usage

* **`npm run make-docs file1.sol file2.sol...`** to generate documentation for solidity files
* **`npm run start`** to start docusaurus dev server
* **`npm run build`** to create docusaurus production build
* **`npm run grammar`** to update parser and lexer after making any changes to the `Solidity.g4` file

## Project structure

* **`docs`** Contains default documentation files and autogenerated `.sol.md` files (one per contract)
* **`parser`** Blatant copy of [solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr) which uses the modified grammar and a modified AST builder to associate natspec comments to the corresponding nodes
* **`sample`** Sample contract with natspec comments, useful for testing
* **`src`** The only actually original code on this project
* **`website`** Modified docusaurus template

## TODOs

- [ ] Actually parse and format natspec comments
- [ ] Create sidebar categories based on contracts folder hierarchy
- [ ] Cross-referencing of contracts and functions
- [ ] Clean up the docusaurus template to remove all unneeded placeholders generated by `docusaurus-init`
- [ ] Clean up the parser with natspec comments support, and send a PR to [solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr), so we don't copy and modify @federicobond's code (potentially breaking a license or two in the way)
- [ ] Remove all references to openzeppelin, so the generator can be used for any project
- [ ] Add tests for every step
